# steps to setup

1) Import the spring boot project into spring tool suite or STS.
2) update the project.
3) Use mp4 video to transcode into HLS format. because dcl supports only HLS streaming.

# ffmpeg -i <input>/video.mp4 -f hls <output>/video%v.m3u8
  
  Above command is used to transcode the video
  
  <input> - path of the directory where the video file is present
  <output> - path of the directory where the output will be saved

<b>video%v.m3u8</> the name output can be changed to anything as user preferred. <b>_%v.m3u8> but this value should not be changed.
    
    <b>Eg:</b> ffmpeg -i C:/User/desktop/video/video.mp4 -f hls C:/User/desktop/video/output/video%v.m3u8
 
Once the video is transcoded copy the output directory contains m3u8 file and ts files into the video directory of the application.
    
Your application has the following directory structure inside resource folder
    
    resources
    |______ static
            |_______videos

 videos must be kept inside the videos folder with different video directory as below
    
    resources
    |______ static
            |_______videos
                    |______video1
                    |      |_____video1_0.m3u8
                    |      |_____........
                    |
                    |
                    |______video2
                           |_____video2_0.m3u8
                           |_____........
    
    <b>Note: _0.m3u8 is autogenerated by ffmpeg </b>
